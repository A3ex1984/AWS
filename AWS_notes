- Cloud storage 
- Overall hosting provider that includes services

Why it is such a hit
- Everyone wants to put their application on AWS
- Billing is very clear - per hour
- Every service has a microbilling that is very transparent
- Integrated billing dashboard with reports
- It is very stable with minimal outages

EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
- Can get small or big machines

VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
- You get a chunk of a cloud where you can build networks on

S3 - Simple storage Service

RDS - Relational Database service

Route 53 - DNS service

ELB - Elastic Load Balancer
- Scale up web application to any number of users

- Text Mining = deriving meaningful data from natrual langugage Text
- NLP = part of computer science and artificial intelligence which deal with human languages
- Applications of Text Mining/NLP: Sentimental analysis; Chatbot; Speech Recognition; Machine translation (Google Translate)
- 2 parts: Natural Language Understanding adn Natural Language Generation

JSON 
- important concept as programmer and web developer
- Java Script Object Notation
- Data representation format
- Commonly used for APIs and Configs
- Lightweight and easy to read - cleaner than XML 
- Integrates nice with JavaScript
- Represents Strings, Numbers, Booleans, null, Arrays, Objects

UML 
- Unified Modelling Language (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6lqHOVHic)
- UML Class Diagrams (Class, attributes, methods) relationships
- e.g. Class is animal, attributes (significant piece of data, variables) is name, id, age; methods are setName(), eat
- minus sign is private, public is a plus sign, protected is # which can only be accessed by same class
- Relationships (arrow): 
    Inheritance: inherit all attributes of super class - then you can additional specific ones
    Association: they interact with each other e.g. one eats the other
    Aggregation: Diamond arrow
    Composition: Filled diamond arrow: Child object does not exist without the parent
    Multiplicity: 0...1 zero to one; n ....
- UML Use Case Diagrams (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zid-MVo7M-E)
- Useful when explaining concepts or ideas
- Very high level diagram that explains ideas
- Systems, Use Cases, Actors, Relationships
